  ## :pencil: Description

Mastermind is a code-breaking game in which one player (the computer) creates a hidden code, 
and the other player attempts to guess it within a limited number of turns. 
The code consists of a sequence of colored pegs (or numbers/symbols in digital versions), 
typically four, chosen from a fixed set of colors. After each guess, the code-maker 
provides feedback using small pegs or markers: black pegs indicate correct colors 
in the correct positions, while white pegs indicate correct colors in the wrong 
positions. The objective is for the code-breaker to deduce the exact code using 
logical reasoning based on the feedback provided.
